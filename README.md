# CP2020-DigitalCharacterSheet
A framework and command line driver for creating and managing a Cyberpunk 2020 character. No longer working on project at this time.

To Do:
1. Engine.cpp : Modify Stats option (line 528)

Known Bugs:
1. When creating/saving a new Edgerunner, some skill names saved improperly in its corresponding .txt file. It can be worked around by modifiying said .txt, though I am unsure of a fix to the bug at this time.
